    "After that, we are ready to implement final strategy. As we said, we slide ship across board for both orientations and increase counter if ship fits specific location. Code written below is very long and isn't readable, but it's a few times faster than straightforward implementation (because it doesn't recalculate probability matrices every step; instead, it makes adjustments to it, which is cheaper). If you want to see more understandable code which does the same thing (but is slower), look for it in previous commits. "

    "This concludes our final strategy implementation. It should be noted that steps generated with this strategy is not completely identical to original implementation, but the tests I've done confirm that this implementation is (also) correct. Generated graphs above also indicate that our implementation is similar, because graph from the article and graph from this notebook are similar. There may exist some optimizations for this strategy, but in comparison with other strategies, this is the best so far."
